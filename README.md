# 🏃‍♂️ Human Pose Estimation using Machine Learning

This project implements **human pose estimation** using **OpenCV** and **MediaPipe** to detect and analyze human body keypoints from images or webcam feeds.

---

## 📌 Features
✅ Detects **human pose keypoints** (shoulders, elbows, knees, etc.)  
✅ Uses **MediaPipe Pose** for high-accuracy pose estimation  
✅ Works with **both images and webcam**  
✅ Can be run **locally** or on **Google Colab**
